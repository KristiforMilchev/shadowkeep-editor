#### Purpose

The "Shadowkeep software" is free software, intended to ease the life of book writers, by providing an integrated enviroment where they can plan and execute their amazing work. In order to keep the software truely free we decided to build our own editor but at the same time we want this editor to be usable standalone for any desktop software under the flutter/dart ecosystem. Thus we strive to keep it abstracted from the main repository.
